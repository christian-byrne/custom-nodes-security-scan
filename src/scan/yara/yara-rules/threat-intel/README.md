# threat-intel

This repository contains IoCs related to Volexity public threat intelligence blog posts and tools published by Volexity's threat intelligence team.

In the past this repository was also used to store tools published by Volexity. These tools have now been moved into dedicated per-tool repositories which can be found [here](https://github.com/volexity).

## IOCs

They are organised by year, and within each year, each folder relates to a specific post.

Each post approximately follows the same folder structure - some files or folders may be missing if there is no applicable data for the post.

```text
