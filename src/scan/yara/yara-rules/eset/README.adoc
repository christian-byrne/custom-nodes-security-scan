Here are indicators of compromise (IOCs) of our various investigations. We are
doing this to help the broader security community fight malware wherever it
might be.

* `.yar` files are http://plusvic.github.io/yara/[Yara] rules
* `.rules` files are http://snort.org/[Snort] rules
* `samples.md5`, `samples.sha1` and `samples.sha256` files are newline
  separated list of hexadecimal digests of malware samples

If you would like to contribute improved versions please send us a pull
request.

If you've found false positives give us the details in an issue report and
we'll try to improve our IOCs.
